## Overview
The **ST Robotics Android App** is an app designed to scan, connect, and control nodes/robots using a controller. The app also allows users to view sensor data in real-time(Accelerometer, Magnetometer, Gyroscope), access debug console, and more. It leverages the **Blue ST SDK** for the logic part of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication.

## Features
- **Scan and Connect**: Easily scan for available nodes/robots and establish a connection.
- **Controller GUI**: Intuitive graphical user interface to control the connected nodes/robots.
- **Real-time Sensor Data**: View sensor data being plotted in real-time.
- **Debug Console**: Access a debug console for troubleshooting and debugging.
- **BLE Communication**: Utilizes the Blue ST SDK for efficient BLE communication.

## Requirements
- **Android Device**: The app is compatible with Android (Minimum android 8 (Oreo) - SDK 26 )
- **Bluetooth**: Ensure that your device has Bluetooth capabilities.
